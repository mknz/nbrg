# nbrg
grep for Jupyter Notebook written in Rust

Like [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), recursively searchs directories on default.

Currently it searches only code cells, and ignores hidden directories.

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mknz/nbrg.git
$ cd nbrg
$ cargo install --path .
```
